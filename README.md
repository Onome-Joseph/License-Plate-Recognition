# License Plate Recognition Model  

## Overview  
This project implements a **License Plate Recognition Model** capable of detecting license plates from images and videos, extracting the license plate text, and displaying it. The model is specifically programmed for the **United Kingdom license plate format** but can be easily reconfigured to work with other countries' formats.

## Key Features  
- **Accurate Detection**: Identifies license plates in images and videos with high precision.  
- **Text Extraction**: Extracts and displays license plate text from detected plates.  
- **Configurable**: Supports reconfiguration for other countries' license plate formats.
- **Data Scrapping**: Saves every license plate detected image and  detected frames of a video in '.csv' file.   

## Applications  
1. **Traffic Management**:  
   - Automate traffic law enforcement through real-time monitoring.  
   - Identify vehicles for toll collection or congestion charging.  
2. **Security and Surveillance**:  
   - Enhance security at gated communities, offices, or parking lots by recording license plate data.  
   - Integrate with surveillance systems for law enforcement.  
3. **Fleet Management**:  
   - Monitor and manage vehicle fleets for logistics and transportation businesses.

4 **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to diverse geographic regions and plate formats.  
5 **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the need for manual labor and improves operational productivity.  

## Future Enhancements    
1. Integrate with a database to fetch detailed vehicle records for detected license plates.  
2. Support real-time updates for license plate recognition in live video feeds.  

## Installation and Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Onome-Joseph/license-plate-recognition.git  
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   - Upload your image or video files.  
   - Configure the parameters as needed for your use case.  
   - Execute the model to detect and extract license plate details.
